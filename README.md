## ⚜️ Executive Summary

**Astoria** is an enterprise-grade hospitality management ecosystem designed for the modern ultra-luxury hotel. By fusing robust **.NET Core** architecture with a Reactive **Next.js** frontend and a sentient **Python AI** cortex, Astoria delivers an unparalleled experience for guests and operational supremacy for management.

Our platform does not just manage bookings; it orchestrates the entire symphony of a hotel's daily life, from dynamic pricing algorithms that react to market pulses, to real-time concierge dispatching driven by guest intent.

## 💎 The Collection (Core Features)

### 🛎️ The Guest Experience (Web Mobile)
*   **Seamless Reservations**: A fluid, animated booking engine that locks inventory in real-time, preventing double-booking conflicts even during high-traffic events.

*   **Sentient Invoices**: Automated, beautifully rendered PDF receipts available instantly upon checkout.

### 🧠 The Oracle (AI Cortex)
*   **Dynamic Valuation**: Our Pricing Engine (`PricingService`) consults with the AI to adjust room rates based on sentiment analysis, demand forecasting, and historical trends.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: Every guest review is analyzed by our NLP models to extract emotional tone, categorized into Actionable Insights for the General Manager.

### 🛡️ The Command Center (Admin Dashboard)
*   **God-View Analytics**: A gamified leaderboard tracks top-performing suites, staff efficiency, and revenue velocity.
*   **Live Operations**: Housekeeping tasks are dispatched in real-time via SignalR—rooms turn from "Dirty" to "Pristine" on the dashboard instantly.
*   **Audit Trails**: Every price change, every booking modification is cryptographically logged for absolute accountability.
